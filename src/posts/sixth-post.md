## Introduction:

Express is a popular and lightweight web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building
robust and scalable web servers. In this beginner's guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a simple server using Express.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js and npm: Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine.
You can download them from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target=_blank> official Node.js website.</a>

## Step 1: Create a New Project

First, let's create a new directory for our project and navigate into it using the terminal:

mkdir simple-express-server

cd simple-express-server

## Step 2: Initialize a Node.js Project

Next, initialize a new Node.js project using the following command:

npm init -y

This command will create a package.json file, which is used to manage project dependencies and
configurations.

## Step 3: Install Express

Now, let's install Express as a dependency for our project:

npm install express

This command will download and install Express into your project.

## Step 4: Create the Express Server

Now, let's create a file named server.js and open it in your code editor. In this file, we'll set up a basic Express server:

```ts
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this code:

<ul>
<li> We import the express module and create an instance of the express application.</li>
<li> We define a route for the root URL ('/') and send a simple "Hello, world!" message as the response.</li>
<li> We start the server and listen on port 3000.</li>
</ul>

## Step 5: Run the Server

To start the server, run the following command in the terminal:

node server.js

You should see the message "Server is running at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target=_blank>http://localhost:3000"</a> in the terminal.

## Step 6: Test the Server

Open a web browser or use an API testing tool like Postman to navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target=_blank>http://localhost:3000</a>. You should see the "Hello, world!" message displayed in the browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple Express server. From here, you can continue to add more routes, handle different HTTP methods, and integrate additional functionality to suit your specific application needs.

## Conclusion

Express provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building web servers, making it a great choice for both small projects and large-scale applications. Happy coding!
